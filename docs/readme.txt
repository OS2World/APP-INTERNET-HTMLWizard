To install HTML Wizard, run install.cmd after unzipping the zip
archive in your chosen directory. Then copy the file VROBJ.DLL
to a directory in your LIBPATH. If you have no idea what I am 
talking about, copy it to \OS2\DLL.

To see the help file, view htmlwiz.inf by typing "view htmlwiz.inf".
There you will find information on the features of the program as
well as changes made to each version. Registration  information
is detailed in the online help file as well.

Thanks for trying HTML Wizard. If you have any questions/comments/problems,
I can be reached at terrell@gnv.fdt.net.
